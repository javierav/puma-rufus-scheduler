[Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma) plugin to run [Rufus Scheduler](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler).


## Installation

1. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "puma-rufus-scheduler"
```

2. Install dependencies with bundler:

```shell
bundle install
```

3. Add the following line to your `config/puma.rb`:

```ruby
plugin "rufus-scheduler"
```

4. Create your scheduler file in `config/scheduler.rb`:

```ruby
scheduler = Rufus::Scheduler.new

scheduler.every "5s" do
  puts "Every 5 seconds #{Time.current}"
end

# This will attach scheduler thread to Puma's background thread.
# Dont forget to add this line!
scheduler.join
```

5. Start your Puma server and you should see the scheduler running:

```
$ bin/rails server

=> Rails 7.1.3.2 application starting in development
...

## Configuration

You can change the scheduler file path by setting the `RUFUS_SCHEDULER_FILE` environment variable:

```shell
RUFUS_SCHEDULER_FILE=config/my_scheduler.rb bin/rails server
```
